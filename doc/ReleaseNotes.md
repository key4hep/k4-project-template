  - Move the tests to its own folder
  - Use general code to set the environment for the tests, with explanation about why each path is needed. This should work in most repositories (at least those that have all the tests in one folder) without changes, avoiding the current status of copy & paste and confusion.
  - Other updates in the README on how to use this project as a template

* 2025-06-20 BrieucF ([PR#28](https://github.com/key4hep/k4-project-template/pull/28))
